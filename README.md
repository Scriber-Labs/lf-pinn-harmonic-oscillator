# lf-pinn-harmonic-oscillator
A **low-fidelity physics-informed neural network (PINN)** demonstrating how physics can guide learning via variational principles. 
- Simulates a **1D simple harmonic oscillator (SHO)** with an unknown frequency while softly enforcing the equation of motion and analyzing 
energy conservation.
- Prioritizes geometric intuition and failure-mode visibility over benchmark performance.
- Motivated by the perspective taken by Kutz & Brunton (2022) that parsimony itself is a powerful regularizer in physics informed machine learning (PIML).

> 🥅 The purpose of this repo is to serve as a foundational teaching module in PIML design, emphasizing **interpretability** and **parsimony** over accuracy or performance.

## 🔰 Implementation Overview
### Physical system: Simple Harmonic oscillator (SHO)

We model a non-dimensionalized 1-D SHO using the Lagrangian,

  $$ L(q,\dot{q}) = \frac{1}{2}\dot{q}^2 - \frac{1}{2}\omega^2 q^2 $$

where $q(t)$ denotes the trajectory of the oscillator's position about an equilibrium point. 
  
### Neural ansatz: $q_\theta(t) = \text{MLP}(t, \theta)$

</p>

> **Architecture:**  
> $$\text{Linear} \rightarrow \tanh \rightarrow \text{Linear} \rightarrow \tanh \rightarrow \text{Linear}$$

- The  multilayer perceptron (MLP) maps time $t$ to a scalar output $q_\theta(t)$ represented the predicted trajectory of the SHO in 1D space.

- Each linear layer performs an affine change of coordinates, while the interwoven $\tanh$ activations introduce smooth nonlinear distortions.

- The composition of these layers allows the network to approximate curved dynamical trajectories while remaining differentiable, enabling physics-informed (soft) constraints
to bias the learned dynamics toward Hamiltonian structure.

### Variational loss (soft constraint $\Rightarrow$ low fidelity) 

Rather than solving the equations of motion exactly, the **Euler-Lagrange residual** is penalized at collation points in time.

  $$ \mathcal{L}_{phys} = \bigg< \bigg( \frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}} - \frac{\partial L}{\partial q} \bigg)^2 \bigg> $$

Which can be simplified to:

  $$ \mathcal{L}_{phys} = \big<(\ddot{q} + \omega^2 q)^2 \big> $$

> This encourages the network to respect physical dynamics. Note that the physical dynamics we want the model to respect are not directly enforced - hence "low-fidelity".

## Five Machine Learning Stages (Brunton-inspired) 
### A. Problem formulation ✔️
    
   > **Research Question:** Can a neural function approximator recover physically meaningful motion via minimization of a **variational residual**, rather than fitting observed data?
   
### B. Data collection and curation ✖️
- Intentionally minimal (i.e., no observational trajectories).
- Collocation points in time serve as synthetic "data" to embed physics into training.
    
### C. Neural architecture ⚠️
- Low-depth MLP, scalar input $\rightarrow$ scalar output, `tanh` activations.
- No convolutions, recurrence, or unnecessary inductive biases.
- Physics enters through the **loss function**, not the architecture.

### D. Loss function ✅

$$\mathcal{L}_{phys} = \Big< (\ddot{q} + \omega^2q)^2\Big>$$
Encodes Euler-Lagrange structure, second-order dynamics, and physical consistency.

### E. Optimization Strategy ❎⚠️
-  Standard Adam optimizer with fixed learning rate.
-  Optimization is intended to **reveal physical structure**, rather than fully customize for performance.

## ⚠️ Limitations & Observable Failure Modes
This section documents both  theoretical limitations *and* the concrete failure modes that appear during training and evaluation. These behaviors are expected and are intentionally exposed to support interpretablity.
### 1. Spectral bias and Collocation Resolution
Increasing $\omega$ or $T_\text{max}$ too much causes aliasing (conceptually analogous to Nyquist sampling). This behavior is consistent with reported PINN failure modes under undersampling (Basir & Senocak, 2022).
  - Insufficient point density will be unable to resolve the curvature 'resolution' that is required by the governing differential equations.
  - Neural networks naturally learn lower-frequency components first. High-frequency oscillators may require specialized architectures or adaptive sampling.

📝 **Note:** A low-resolution collocation density breaks conservation even if optimization converges.
> 🏡 In practice, collocation density should scale with both the simulation window and the highest frequency content expected in the solution.

### 2. **Constraint Interference**
Increasing $T_\text{max}$ increases non-convexity, introduces more competing constraints, and creates saddle points and narrow/unstable basins of attraction.
- This manifests as gradually increasing "spike-amplitudes" in the training curve and reflects the optimizer being repeatedly redirected by global physics constraints (see Figure 1 in `../artifacts/figures.md`).
- Ultimately prevents the model converging to a stable basin.
    
### 3. **Soft Constraints** 
Unlike symplectic integrators, this model does not strictly conserve the Hamiltonian, 
   - As the time window increases, the overall domain grows and the trivial solution $\begin{bmatrix} q_\theta \\ p_\theta \end{bmatrix} = \mathbf{0}$ increasingly dominates the loss landscape due to global satisfaction of physical constraints. 
   - This is expected in 'pure' physics-informed learning without data anchoring.

### 4. **Resampling Trade-offs**
   - **Static Points:** Stable training, but the model might overfit constraint satisfaction at specific locations.
   - **Dynamic (Resampled) Points:** Better generalization across the whole domain,  but introduces variance (i.e., "noise") in the training curve.

### 5. **Extrapolation (OOD)** 
   - As a global function approximator trained on a bounded domain, the MLP primarily interpolates within the training domain (Brunton & Kutz, 2022). 
   - Consequently, performance degrades rapidly outside the training window $[0, 2\pi]$ unless periodic inductive biases are introduced.

---

## Next Steps
- Explore ways to implement adaptive sampling.
- Train models with learnable frequency $\omega$.
- Condition the network explicitly on $\omega$.
- Explore richer low-fidelity physics constraints and Hamiltonian structure preservation (e.g., energy conservation loss term).
- Explore ways to introduce inductive biases (limitations).
