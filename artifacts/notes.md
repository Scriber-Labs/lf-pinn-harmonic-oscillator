### Bilinear skew-symmetric map
A function $\omega : V\times V \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is **bilinear** and **skew-symmetric** if and only if it is linear in
    $$ \forall u,v \in V, \quad \omega(u,v)=-\omega(v,u)$$

🏡 **Take-Home Message:** Skew symmetry alone does not imply a function is bilinear. 
### Non-degeneracy
Let $V$ be a vector space over the real numbers, and let $\omega: V\times V \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be a function that is 'linear in each argument'. 

The function $\omega$ is said to be **non-degenerate** iff: 
        
$$ \{ v \in V | \forall w\in V, \omega(v,w)=0\} = \{ 0 \} $$

In other words, $\omega$ is a non-degenerate function if and only if the zero vector is the only vector that pairs to zero along with every other vector in $v\in V$.

💎 **Gem Take-away:** "Non-degeneracy means there exists an invertible mapping $\omega$ between vectors and covectors.


### Symplectic form
- Casual Definition: A **symplectic form** is a smooth, closed, non-degenerate skew-symmetric 2-form that tells us how to measure 'area' in a phase-space. 
- Technical definition: A **symplectic form** is a non-degenerate, closed 2-form defining the canonical orientation and geometery of phase space. This includes signed area (recal: orientation + signed area = bivector)
  
  - For a 1D system in phase-spacae $(q,p)$, the corresponding symplectic form is $$ \omega = dq\wedge dp $$
  - Properties:
     1. **closed:** $d\omega = 0$ 
     2. **non-degenerate**
     3. **smooth** as a differential form ❓
     4. **antisymmetric**: $$dq\wedge dp = -dp \wedge dq$$
        Importantly, this antisymmetry property of phase space in physics is the root of:
        - Poisson brackets
        - Hamilton's equations
        - Conservation of phase-space volume

## Symplectic Forms and Harmonic Oscillator PINNs
<img src="assets/images/action_area.png" alt="Action as the area inside the energy contour." width="500">

For the 1D harmonic oscillator PINN, the symplectic form $\omega = dq \wedge dp$ induces Hamilton's equations:
$$ \dot{q}= \frac{\partial H}{\partial p}, \quad \dot{p}=-\frac{\partial H}{\partial q}$$

where 

$$H(q,p) = \frac{p^2}{2m} + \frac{1}{2}k q^2 $$

is the Hamiltonian for the 1D harmonic oscillator. This is the actual constraint you want your PINN to respect. 


In this repository, "low-fidelity PINN" means that physical structure is encouraged via soft penalty terms in the loss function (rather than enforced exactly). The main point is to produce interpretible results; NOT to build a fully syumplectic 'neural' (❓) integrator. In other words, the models is not guaranteed to be symjplectic, however it is biased to wards the Hamiltonian.

According to chat-GPT, low-fidelity means (🤔 is this a technical description, or just approximate)...
- Penalizing violations of symplectic structure 
- It is not exactly enforced (🤔 what exactly (pardon the pun) does this mean?).

Examples of valid LF constraints:
- Penalizing the residuals...
    $$ \begin{align*}
        \partial_tq - \frac{\partial H}{\partial p},  \\ \\
        \partial_tp + \frac{\partial H}{\partial q}
        \end{align*}    $$

- Penalizing phase-space volume drift.

## Clifford Algebra Detour
In Clifford algebra $\omega = \partial_q \wedge \partial_p$ is just a bivector:
    $$ \partial_q \wedge \partial_p = \frac{1}{2}(\partial_q\partial_p - \partial_p\partial_q)$$

💎 Therefore, we can say $\omega$ generates rotations in phase space and Hamiltonian flow is a *bivector-generated motion*. 

### Bivector Operator as a Symplectic Matrix
The matrix $$J = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ -1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$$ is the matrix representation of $dq\wedge dp$.
In Clifford algebra language:
- $J$ is equivalent to multiplication by the phase-space pseudoscalar.
- Poisson brackets are bivector contractions.
- Hamilton's equations are rotations generated by the bivector $\omega$.
